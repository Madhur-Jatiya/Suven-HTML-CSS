# Suven-Consultants
During my two-week internship at Suven Consultants, I worked on front-end web development projects for their client-facing websites.
I designed and implemented user interfaces, optimized website performance. 
Projects included a landing page for a new product launch, a blog page, and a contact form page. 
The internship taught me valuable skills in front-end web development and collaboration in a professional setting.
